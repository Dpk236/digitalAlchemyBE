    "question": "How are waves generated in a string?",
    "answer": "When one end of a string is tied and the other end is moved up and down, a wave is generated in the string.",
    "timestamp": "00:00:38"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do the individual particles of the string remain stationary during wave motion?",
    "answer": "No, the individual particles of the string move, creating oscillations.",

  {
    "question": "What do mechanical waves require for propagation?",
    "answer": "Mechanical waves need a medium to propagate.",
    "timestamp": "00:01:00"

  {
    "question": "Give one example of a mechanical wave.",
    "answer": "Waves in a string or sound waves.",
    "timestamp": "00:01:50"

  {
    "question": "What type of waves can travel through a vacuum?",
    "answer": "Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum.",
    "timestamp": "00:02:14"

  {
    "question": "Are waves in a spring or string mechanical or non-mechanical waves?",
    "answer": "They are mechanical waves.",
    "timestamp": "00:02:37"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are compressions and rarefactions in a spring?",
    "answer": "Compressions and rarefactions are regions where particles are close together and far apart, respectively, created as waves travel through a spring.",
    "timestamp": "00:03:36"
  },
  {
    "question": "How many types of mechanical waves are there?",
    "answer": "Mechanical waves are of two types.",
    "timestamp": "00:03:57"
  },
  {
    "question": "In a string, how do particles move compared to the direction of wave propagation?",
    "answer": "Each particle moves up and down, perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels.",
    "timestamp": "00:04:16"
  },
  {
    "question": "Define a transverse wave.",
    "answer": "In a transverse wave, the motion of the particle of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.",
    "timestamp": "00:04:37"
  },
  {
    "question": "Define a longitudinal wave.",
    "answer": "In a longitudinal wave, the motion of the particle is in the direction of the wave, and compressions and rarefactions are formed.",
